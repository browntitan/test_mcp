# Cybersecurity (DFARS 252.204-7012 / NIST SP 800-171) Policy

## Purpose
Define minimum cybersecurity obligations for suppliers handling Covered Defense Information (CDI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

## Requirements
1. Controls: Implement NIST SP 800-171 security requirements for systems processing CDI/CUI.
2. Incident Reporting: Cyber incidents affecting CDI/CUI must be reported rapidly per DFARS 252.204-7012.
3. Media Protection: Encrypt removable media and ensure proper sanitization.
4. Subcontractors: Flow down DFARS cybersecurity requirements to all relevant subcontractors.

## Assessment
Suppliers must provide current SSP/POA&M artifacts upon request.
