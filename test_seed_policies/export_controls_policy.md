# Export Controls & ITAR/EAR Compliance Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes mandatory requirements for handling export-controlled technical data and items under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

## Scope
Applies to all suppliers, subcontractors, and personnel who may access controlled technical data, defense articles, defense services, or dual-use items.

## Requirements
1. Classification: Suppliers must determine and document the export classification (ITAR USML category or EAR ECCN) for all deliverables.
2. Access Controls: Controlled technical data must be stored and transmitted only through approved systems with role-based access control.
3. Authorization: No export, re-export, or deemed export may occur without documented authorization.
4. Incident Reporting: Suspected export control violations must be reported within 24 hours.

## Contractual Flowdown
Suppliers must flow down applicable ITAR/EAR clauses and ensure subcontractors comply with the same requirements.

## Evidence
Maintain records for at least 5 years, including classification determinations, licenses, and access logs.
